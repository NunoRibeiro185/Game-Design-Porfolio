# Porfolio

Repo where I keep my Porfolio 


# Everybody's Sick Now
This game was made for MOJO (game jam event in IST - the university I studied in) and also for a Game Design course.
In this course we went through the full process of game design and some game development. We started with several ideas, brainstorms, moved to high concepts and more in depth concepts, started development with prototypes, moved on to a first game iteration and eventually with a Post Mortem.

# Music
Some Song Demos and Soundtracks that I have made
Keep in mind some where made a long time ago and not all are mixed/mastered
